# Interview-Intelligence
A big MNC who usually hires more than 10k candidates every year.
To complete the task they conduct more than 1 lakhs interviews every year.
Interview-Intel is the modern way to approach hiring by harmonizing all aspects of the interview process into a beautiful symphony. An interview intelligence tool records,
transcribes, and analyzes candidate conversations. It helps the hiring managers, recruiters, and HR Business Partners (HRBPs) to gain deeper visibility into the
interview process, create smooth feedback loops between the panelists, and improve the overall recruitment process.
You need to predict the status of the interviews so that recruiters can check the sanity of the interview and find if the interview was biased.
